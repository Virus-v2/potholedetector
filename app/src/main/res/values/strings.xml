    <string name="about1">Potholes are a major source of a lot of problems we see on Indian roads. Slow moving traffic, lower mileage, high maintenance
        and injuries, all of these issues are linked to potholes and poor roads.
    </string>
    <string name="about2">Because this problem exists everywhere and happens all the time, the government cannot fix everything.
        We should not rely on the government for everything and in fact many students have found ways to fix small potholes.
        \n\nWe want to enable everyone to help solve this problem
